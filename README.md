#Hello!
My name is Steven Schonlau and I am a freshman at Purdue studying computer science. This is a project I created through the Launchpad club with my mentor, Mark.
I wanted to create something that could have a socially beneficial impact. While this project won't be used in the real world, I wanted to try my best and learn along the way.
My project is a web-based game called Scam Slam. The goal was to enable elementary age students in identifying email scams. This is done with a moveable character that goes around an email shooting viruses that come from links.
I used HTML, CSS, and a JavaScript plugin called [p5js](https://p5js.org/). This allowed me to make an animated game with characters that I created in MS paint.

##Here's a video of the game in action:

##Results of this project:
I learned a lot about reading references as I was completely new to p5js and I also learned a lot about layouts in HTML. I also learned how to modularize code more efficiently to avoid repetition.
